Alan Turing was a mathematician who was born in London in 1912.  
After going through college, he joined the Government Code and Cypher School, just in time for World War II.  
During World War II, he and his team designed a code-breaking machine called the Bombe, which provided a lot of useful information to the Allied Powers.  
After World War II, due to his great work, he was recruited to the National Physical Laboratory in London.  
At the National Physical Laboratory, he designed one of the first electronic computers, although it was not built.  
Later, he developed the first programming manual, and his programming system was used in the first commercially available digital computer, the Ferranti Mark I.  
Although he did not ever work on an artificial intelligence, Alan Turing put forth a lot of the thinking and theory about artificial intelligence.
